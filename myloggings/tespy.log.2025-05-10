-> given temperature with given pressure in two phase region, try setting enthalpy instead or provide accurate starting value for pressure.
-> given logarithmic temperature differences or kA-values for heat exchangers, 
-> support better starting values.
-> bad starting value for fuel mass flow of combustion chamber, provide small (near to zero, but not zero) starting value.

-> given temperature with given pressure in two phase region, try setting enthalpy instead or provide accurate starting value for pressure.
-> given logarithmic temperature differences or kA-values for heat exchangers, 
-> support better starting values.
-> bad starting value for fuel mass flow of combustion chamber, provide small (near to zero, but not zero) starting value.

-> given temperature with given pressure in two phase region, try setting enthalpy instead or provide accurate starting value for pressure.
-> given logarithmic temperature differences or kA-values for heat exchangers, 
-> support better starting values.
-> bad starting value for fuel mass flow of combustion chamber, provide small (near to zero, but not zero) starting value.
